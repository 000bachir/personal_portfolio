          Since you’ve landed on this part of the website, let me tell you a bit about myself. <br>
            
            I’m a self-taught developer from Algeria. I didn’t study computer science, and honestly, I don’t think that makes me better than people who did—in fact, it’s the opposite. Graduates often have a deeper understanding of how computers really work 😅. 
            <br>
            I’m not here to bash them with the cliché "they don’t know what they’re doing." The truth is: most of the time i pray that my code works 
            <br>
            and two , I use tools like YouTube, and LLMs to learn and find solutions 🙃.
            <br>
            <br>
            You won’t hear me bragging about being some kind of genius who cracks every problem with magical methods 😎. I’m not. I’m lazy at times, not the smartest person in the room, and yes—I’ve had disagreements with colleagues. 
            What pushed me to learn coding? Like many others: money. But along the way, I realized it wasn’t just that. Coding became a way for me to make peace with the fact that I didn’t do well in college.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the record, I’m actually a certified French teacher. That’s not exactly the fast lane to success in life. But as they say—“idiots have big dreams,” right 🤔?
            If this is your first time checking out my portfolio, I’ll admit: I kinda  copied someone’s design and tweaked it 🤫
            <br>
            I’m not great with colors; I mostly just wear black and white in real life so that tells you a lot about myself 😑
            <br>
            <br>
            I’ve always hated those generic “I’m a passionate, hardworking, team-playing, coffee-fueled machine” kind of stuff. Since this portfolio is mine, I’m writing it the way I want like a so called artist how understand life beter then anyone else 🤣.So yeah—why did I start coding? Because I was falling behind in life, and I needed to do something about it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Again i’m not a unicorn developer or worker who never makes mistakes. I’m just a real person trying to figure things out, one commit at a time.
            <br>
            <br>

                I don’t have much experience in tech jobs, mainly because opportunities are very limited where I live.  
                <br>
                To put it simply, most of my work has been in factories or as a store manager in a mobile phone shop.  
                <br>
                After graduation, I started teaching French and English — mostly as a freelancer or offering lessons from home.  
                <br><br>
                I’m not a certified English teacher, but I’ve mastered the language and hold an IELTS certificate (which I always mention to families before starting lessons).  
                <br>
                Most of this is already covered in my more “polished” résumé, but hopefully this gives you a clearer picture of who I am 😅
